# Introduction
Hi I am Yi (she/her), an undergrad at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Statistics.

I've had over more than 1 year of research experience at a Reinforcement Learning (RL)and HCI lab, where I participated in many research projects that created AI tools for health. 

I was also fortunately awarded a department scholarship during summer 2023 to work on a RL algorithm powered mental health text message system. (As you probably got to this link from my resume)



## What I am curious about?
I am mainly interested in Machine-learning, reinforcememnt learning, and creating meanginful AI tools for good (mental health and education).


# What this repo is about?
This is a repo that contained all relevant material to my past and current research work*. 
NOTE: this repo is still being updated as of Summer 2024

*Due to adherence to academic copy right and work being under review, not all of the work that I was involved in will be posted on this public repo. 

For the work that cannot be put on this repo due to the above reason, I will write 
- a short paragraph explain what the project was about, 
- a reflection on what I learned, 
- further research questions I had from my involvement of the project. 



# How is it organized ?
Each research project is a folder, containing 
1. a short description of the research project
2. examples of my participation in the project, ex. abstracts, posters, images  **
3. my reflection on what I learned about this project' field and research process
4. what it push me to think about for further research questions and directions

** Due to adherence to good research conduct and intellectual property rights for PIs, some of my particpation may not be able to display on here.
