# Introduction
Hi I am Yi (she/her), an undergrad at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Statistics.

I've had over more than 1 year of research experience at a Reinforcement and HCI lab, where I participated in many research projects that investigated how to create meaningful and non-harmful interaction between humans and AI. 

## What I am curious about?
I am mainly interested in Machine-learning, reinforcememnt learning, and creating meanginful AI tools for good (mental health and education).


# What this repo is about?
This is a repo that contained all relevant material to my past and current research work* .

*Due to adherence to academic copy right and work being under review, not all of the work that I was involved in will be posted on this public repo. 

For the work that cannot be put on this repo due to the above reason, I will write 
- a short paragraph explain what the project was about, 
- a reflection on what I learned, 
- further research questions I had from my involvement of the project. 



## How is it organized ?
Each research project is a folder, containing 
1. a short description of the research project
2. examples of my participation in the project, ex. abstracts, posters, images  **
3. my reflection on what I learned about this project' field and research process
4. what it push me to think about for further research questions and directions
